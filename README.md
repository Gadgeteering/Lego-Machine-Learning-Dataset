# Lego Brick Sorter Machine


This project is inspired by Daniel West's project to build a Lego sorter

[Lego Sorter][3]

This is a nice explantion of the three steps to build a Lego sorter

1.  [Build a dataset to train the AI] [1] using the [Ldraw Library][3] and use [blender] [2] to render the image

2.  Train the AI using Tensorflow

3.  Build a image capature and classification process
